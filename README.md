# Investigate-TMDb-Movie-Dataset
The tmdb dataset contains information about 10,000 movie titles, ranging from production cost, revenue performance, rating, reviews, cast, genre to release year etc.
This goal of this project is finding how production cost trends over time across the different genres, and how they relate to success and popularity.
